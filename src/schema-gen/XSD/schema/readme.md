# XML Schema support

Note - [the schema included here](./XMLSchema-1.0.xsd) is *not the same* as [the schema included in the Metaschema submodule](../../../../support/metaschema/support/xml/XMLSchema.xsd).

While that schema describes XSD 1.1, this described only XSD 1.0. This application generates XSD 1.0 for widest possible tools support.

The [standard.xsd module](xml.xsd) (for attributes in the XML namespace) is included here for convenience, in order to avoid having to alter the calling file.
